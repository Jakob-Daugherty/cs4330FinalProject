 Python vs. C#

### Comparison Criteria

| Criteria                                            | Python | C# |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|----|
| Language purpose/genesis                            | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/license.html) was created in the early 1990's by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum in the Netherlands. As an interpreted language, python has emphasized code readability, and reducing the number of lines of code required to express concepts. Guido van Rossum envisioned python as a successor of a language called [ABC](http://homepages.cwi.nl/~steven/abc/programmers/handbook.html). ABC is a language intended to be used in place of BASIC, Pascal or AWK. | C# was created with roots in the C family of languages as a simple, modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. Further addressing support of component-oriented programming, by providing features such as, garbage-collection, exception handling, and type-safe design. These features provide a more natural approach to developing software components than C++, Java, and JavaScript. |
| Unique features of the language                     | Python, differing from most programming languages, requires no type declarations. Essentially eliminating the idea of incompatible data types. | C# ensures that programs and libraries can evolve over time and remain compatible, using versioning. Essentially eliminating the idea of "dll hell" when new library versions are released. |
| Name spaces                                         | In [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces), a name space is a mapping from names to objects, and eliminates confusion around similar names in different namespaces by using prefixed module names. Namespaces are used to determine the scope of names at time of execution, providing a global namespace for the current function and a module namespace for outside functions. | In [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/language-reference/keywords/namespace), the ```namespace``` keyword is used to declare a scope that contains a set of related objects. You can use a namespace to organize code elements and to create globally unique types; like a class, interface, or another namespace. |
| Types                                               | The principal built in types are numerics, sequences, mappings, classes, instances and exceptions. Python uses ["call-by-object,"](http://www.python-course.eu/passing_arguments.php) meaning Python will initially behave like call-by-reference, but as soon as you change the value of an object, Python "switches" to call-by-value. Class definitions allow for the creation of new types. | [In C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/types/index), every variable and constant has a type, as does every expression that evaluates to a value. Value types are derived from System.ValueType, and any reference type is defined as a class, delegate, array, or interface. New value types can be created as enums and structs. |
| Classes                                             | [Python's](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#a-first-look-at-classes) class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of syntax and semantics. Providing standard Object Oriented Programming functions like inheritance and method overriding, and dynamic creation and modification. An example of a python class can be found [Here](classPython.md). | Classes, in [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/classes), are more similar to classes in Java, JavaScript, or C++. The definition controls the data and behavior of a user defined data type, as a collection of other data types. An example of a C# class can be found [Here](classCs.md). |
| Instance reference name in data type (class)        | self | this |
| Properties                                          | [Python properties](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property) are a default system function to link getters and setters to different names. They must be hand written, but can be inherited. An example of Python properties can be found [Here](propertiesPython.md) | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties) allows for auto-implemented getters and setters. Backing variables and computed properties are similar to Java and C++. An example of C# properties can be found [Here](propertiesCs.md) |
| Interfaces / protocols                              | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/abc.html) does not allow for interfaces or protocols, because of the dynamic running environment python executes in. Instead, an Abstract Base Class, or ABC, can grant similar functionality. ABC's use the idea of decorations to define abstract methods. An example of how this is used in python, can be found [Here](interfacePython.md) | [C# interfaces](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/index) can include behavior from multiple sources in a class. Important because C# does not allow for multiple inheritance, but can implement more than one interface. An example of a C# interface can be found [Here](interfaceCs.md) |
| Inheritance / extension                             | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#inheritance) allows for multiple inheritance, and superclass deviation. This requires the superclass to be within the same scope as the derived class, and supports functions like, ```isinstance()``` and ```issubclass()```. This allows for dynamic reflection, and to check and instance's type and confirm superclass inheritance. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/inheritance) classes can only inherit from a single superclass. However, this allows for transitive inheritance, and implicit method inheritance for all superclass methods, except for constructors and destructors. Meaning if ClassC is derived from ClassB, and ClassB is derived from ClassA, ClassC inherits the members declared in ClassB and ClassA. |
| Reflection                                          | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.3/c-api/reflection.html) reflection can be used to find execution attributes of the current execution frame. This can return built-in objects, methods, and current line numbers for the frame of execution. For reflection similar to Java or C++, see Python Inheritance | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/reflection) supports reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type of an existing object. Used to invoke unknown methods, or access an object's fields or properties.  |
| Memory management                                   | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.3/c-api/memory.html) internal memory is handled by the Python memory manager, as a private heap. This manager works with the system memory manager to provide dynamic storage of all required python elements, based on object data type. This means, unless using the Python/C API to directly manage memory, the user has no control over the python memory manager running in the interpreter itself.  | [C#](), as part of the .NET framework employs automatic memory management through garbage collection. Once an object is not accessible by any possible continuation of execution, it will be marked for destruction. Then, at an unspecified later time, the garbage collector frees the memory associated with that object.  |
| Comparisons of references and values                | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons) compares all values using boolean results. Meaning, strings must be truly equal to return true, and all comparisons follow mathematical conventions. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/language-reference/operators/index) labels all comparisons with a precedence from high to low, and compares all values based on arithmetic logic. In the case of strings, they are compared by value, using standard ASCII encoding. Operator overloading is allowed, and can allow the user to redefine operators within a certain scope. |
| Null/nil references                                 | None | null |
| Errors and Exception Handling                       | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#syntax-errors) deals with syntax errors and exceptions. Exceptions are caused during execution and handled with ```try``` followed by ```except```. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/exceptions/index) handles exceptions in a similar method as Java. Using ```try```, ```catch```, and ```finally```.  |
| Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types | [Python](http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/lambda_functions.hawk) supports the creation of anonymous functions using the ```lambda``` keyword. This allows for functions to be assigned to variables, and is similar to, but not quite the same, as Java lambda expressions. | [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/csharp/programming-guide/statements-expressions-operators/lambda-expressions) use the ```=>``` operator to create a lambda expression. These are anonymous function that can be used to create delegates like in Java. |
| Implementation of listeners and event handlers      | Python suggests listeners and event handlers should be implemented using lambda expressions. | C# allows for static and dynamic event handlers. These event type objects can handle many events, and do not require prior understanding of event handling functions. They are created similar to event handlers in Java. |
| Singleton                                           | Python can implement a singleton by delegating to a single instance of a private nested inner class. This can be made thread safe by using the ```__new__``` function instead of ```__init__```. Since Python interprets classes differently lazy singleton instantiation can be done using metaclasses. | [C#](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650316.aspx) Singleton implementation allows static initialization through the .NET framework. Multithreaded singleton can be correctly implemented using a Double-Check Locking idiom.   |
| Procedural programming                              | Can do it with little syntax. | Basically the same as Java, C++, or JavaScript. |
| Functional programming                              | Can do it with little syntax. | Just as good/terrible as Java, C++, or JavaScript. |
| Multithreading                                      | [Python](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/threading.html) provides the system module ```threading``` to perform thread based parallelism.  | C# is granted multithreading capabilities through the .NET framework. |
